= Using MIDI CCs to control jack_mixer =
MIDI CCs can be used to control volume and balance/panorama of channels.

Controller for main channel volume is 7
Controller for main channel balance is 8

Controller for input channels are choosen using predefined algorithm,
first free controller starting from 11, first for volume, next for
balance/panorama.

So, if you don't delete channels, you will get CC#11 used for first
input channel volume, CC#12 for first channel balance/panorama, CC#13
for second channel volume, CC#14 for second channel balance/panorama,
etc.

MIDI CCs are accepted on any channel.

MIDI CC values (0-127) are mapped to dBFS using current slider scale
for corresponding channel.
