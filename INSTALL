Build requirements:
 * You need gcc (3.4.3 should work)
 * You need SWIG (1.3.29 should work)
 * You need python headers (python-dev package or something like that)
 * You need JACK headers (jack-dev package or something like that)

Adjust GNUmakefile to suit your needs.

!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! Ubuntu, chances are that you need
!!! INSTALL_GCONF_SCHEMAS_DIR=/usr/share/gconf/schemas/
!!!!!!!!!!!!

Runtime requirements:
 * You need Python (2.4 should work, maybe 2.3 too - please report)
 * PyGTK with cairo support
 * fpconst (floating point constants) Python module.
   You can use this URL if you cannot find it in more sane place
   http://nedko.arnaudov.name/soft/jack_mixer/fpconst-0.7.2.tar.gz

Runtime optional things, that will enable you to get full functionality:
 * To get LASH (Linux audio session) support, you need Python bindings
   for LASH, currently available at
   http://nedko.arnaudov.name/soft/pylash/, until Dave Robillard is
   kind enough to include them in the official LASH distribution.
   For LASH support you also need PyXML (0.8.4 should work)
 * To get balance/panorama functionality for each channel you need
   pyphat. Get it from http://phat.berlios.de/, you want latest SVN
   version, phat-0.4.0 has some bugs trigered by jack_mixer and misses
   some functionality (like reset to center).
 * If you want your settings to be preserved in GConf you need Python
   bindings for GConf, part of the Python bindings for GNOME. Chances
   are that package you need to install is called gnome-python

Once you have all needed requisites you run "make" to build the mixer
engine and "make install" to install it. Chances are that you will
need superuser (root) access to install. You may want to change
install paths specified at the top of the GNUmakefile.

If you ever need to remove jack_mixer from your system you could run
"make uninstall" to uninstall all installed files.
